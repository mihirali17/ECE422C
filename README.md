# ECE422C

Here are my projects from my Software Design & Implementation II course. This course taught me all about object-oriented programming, specifically the concepts of objects and classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also exposed me to the basic theory and application of important data structures such as array lists, 2D arrays, linked lists, maps, sets, stacks, heaps and queues, and trees and graphs. In terms of algorithms, we learned about recursive programming, backtracking, and BFS/DFS. Other concepts that we were exposed to were multithreading, socket programming, and JavaFX for basic GUI creation. In addition to the fundamentals, this course was most responsible for my proclivity towards Java as my preferred programming language, throgh which I learned how to uphold clean, efficient coding standards and design principles.
