This project served as an introduction to coding in Java and manipulating arrays via sorting, finding, copying, and inserting.
Specifically, some common array manipulation methods that I implemented here include insertion sort and binary search. For each
of the methods implemented, I upheld a time complexity constraint to ensure efficient runtimes. For more details, refer to
SortTools.java to see all the methods I implemented.

In addition to SortTools.java, we had to write our own basic tests to assert that each method was working as intended. This
served as a brief look into software testing, specifically using the JUnit framework. For more details, refer to SampleTest.java
to see all the tests I wrote.
