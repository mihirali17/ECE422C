This project had me design the game Wordle, where the user tries to guess a 4-, 5-, or 6-letter word. The user can configure the game settings, such as number of guesses and the length of the word, using the GameConfiguration object, which is passed into the main game engine class, Game.java. This class processes the user's guesses using a GuessProcessor class to determine the feedback (Green if one of the letters in the guesst is in the target word, and also in the right position, Yellow if one of the letters is in the target word but not in the right position).

This project served as a basic application of object-oriented programming and use of data structures such as ArrayLists to design an interactive game where the user types in input and receives output.
