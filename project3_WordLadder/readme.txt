This project allows the user to input two five-letter words (ex: smart money). The program then attempts to create a "word ladder" between these two words. A word ladder here is defined as a sequence of words that start with the start word and end with the end word, where each word inbetween differs from the word above it by only one letter. The program uses either Breadth First Search or Depth First Search algorithms to attempt to construct a word ladder between the two words.

In addition to utilizing BFS/DFS, this project also taught me extensively about using the PriorityQueue and HashSet data structures.
